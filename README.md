# XFILE
Accelerated matrix Factorization via Infinite Latent Elements with structured shrinkage.

This project includes R functions to perform the XFILE algorithm.
Given a matrix of Gaussian, binary or censored data y, the algorithm performs a fast factorization.
The algorithm allows to take into consideration exogenous matrices x (covariates) and w (meta-covariates) that inform on the similiraty among rows and columns, respectively.
